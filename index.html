        <p>Exhillerating from the word word go!The unique setting of Rathmines ﬂats was something new for everyone 
          I think, but added just the right amount of grit to make you really feel like a part of the story. The actors 
          were excelllent and true to their characters. The guides leading us around the venue were super too, they made sure 
          no one got lost but also remained the - right amount - of annony-mous to allow for a truly beathtaking production.

        <p>A whole new experience. Entering the ﬂats was exhilarating in itself, a place where unless you lived there many 
          wouldn’t normally venture. 
          The layout was fantastic each room different in its own way with a different chapter of the story. The rapping 
          and sound was next level. Lethal Dialect, playing Romeo, stole the show.

        <p>A very memorable experience that I would recommend to anyone. When I went to this show I didn't know what to expect. 
          I didn't read much about it to not spoil it. Exploring the block of ﬂats was exhilerating, and watching the actors perform 
          right in front of me was fantastic. Also I was pulled into the action at one point which made the whole experience even better.

        <p>Deﬁnitely a really cool thing to do in Dublin City! There is nothing like it. Essentially you run around a huge building for 2
           hours chasing actors around to catch their scenes.. I think you could go back a million times and experience it different way each time. 
           I really don't know any play that is like it! I would reccomend researching it a little before you go to help you follow the story.

        <p><i>Something new, thats never been done before. </i></p>
        <p>We wanted to think outside the box for this production. Do something that has never been done before while also keeping in line
           with the story. 
          Thats why the whole show will take place in the unique location of the Rathmines ﬂats. 
          We chose this location for its accessibility, space and authenticity. Entry will be on the main Rathmines Road .
          The audience will be able to roam from room to room and ex-perience the raw performance our actors are excited to give. .</p>
